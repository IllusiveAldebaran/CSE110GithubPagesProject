The command of the day is: `wev`, which is like `xev`. I chose this from my history, sorry guys I know it's useless for most.

I know you guys like github-- I do too, but what about an open source alternative? [github alternative](https://about.gitlab.com).

I know you're seeing this stuff, but how about skipping to what I [like](#interests)?

Oh and how about reading the license? It's the first I found about it, but I think it's a funny name and one that describes what I want from a project from time to time:

[license](LICENSE.md)
